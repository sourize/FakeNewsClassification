# Fake News Classification 📰🚫

## 🚀 Project Overview

Combat misinformation by classifying news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using a deep learning pipeline. Leveraging LSTM-based feature extraction and sequence modeling, this project demonstrates end-to-end NLP capabilities for robust fake news detection.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

* **Data Ingestion & Quality:** Clean and preprocess raw text (headlines and body) to ensure consistency.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transform text into sequences with word embeddings for deep learning input.
* **Model Development:** Build and fine-tune an LSTM network for binary classification.
* **Evaluation & Analysis:** Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 🛠️ Features & Highlights

| Feature                | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text Preprocessing** | Tokenization, stopword removal, and input sequence padding.       |
| **Embedding Layer**    | Leverage pretrained embeddings (e.g., GloVe) for semantic inputs. |
| **LSTM Architecture**  | Stacked LSTM layers with dropout for sequence learning.           |
| **Model Evaluation**   | Generate classification report and confusion matrix plots.        |
| **Modular Pipeline**   | Separate modules for data prep, modeling, and evaluation.         |

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Libraries

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras

     jupyter lab   # or jupyter notebook
     ```
   * Open `FakeNewsClassification.ipynb` and execute all cells.

> **Note:** All required libraries are available in standard Python distributions—no special setup needed.

## 📊 Results & Insights

* **Test Accuracy:** **99%** accuracy on the validation set.
* **Detailed Metrics:** Precision, recall, and F1-scores above 0.98 across both classes.
* **Visualization:** Confusion matrix highlights low false-positive and false-negative rates.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* **Transformer Models:** Integrate BERT or RoBERTa for contextual learning.
* **Data Augmentation:** Expand dataset with more diverse sources to improve generalization.
