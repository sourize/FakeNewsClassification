# Fake News Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying news articles as real or fake using a deep learning approach. By leveraging LSTM-based feature extraction and classification, it aims to enhance the detection of misinformation in digital news sources.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled news articles categorized as `Fake` or `Real`.
- It includes features such as headlines, article body, and source.
- Preprocessing steps include text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization (e.g., Word Embeddings).

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the model training and evaluation:

```bash
jupyter notebook FakeNewsClassification.ipynb
```

## Model Details
- The project uses an LSTM-based deep learning model for classification.
- Feature extraction is done using Word Embeddings.
- Model evaluation is done using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- The LSTM model achieved an accuracy of **99%**.
- Confusion matrix and classification reports are included for analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) for better accuracy.
- Expanding dataset diversity for better generalization.
- Deploying the model as a web service.
